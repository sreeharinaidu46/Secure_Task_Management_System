#  Secure Task Management System

A full-stack role-based task management system built using:

* **Angular 17** (Standalone Components + Tailwind)
* **NestJS** (API + RBAC + JWT Authentication)
* **Nx Monorepo**
* **PostgreSQL + TypeORM**
* **Role-based access control (Owner/Admin/Viewer)**
* **Personal vs Organizational Task Visibility**
* **Jest Unit Tests for both frontend & backend**

---

##  Features

###  Authentication & Authorization

* JWT authentication
* Login & Register with organization assignment
* Role-based access:

  * **Viewer:** Read-only tasks
  * **Admin:** Modify & delete only org tasks
  * **Owner:** Full organization rights

### 📝 Task System

* Create **Personal** or **Work** tasks
* Work tasks visible to **all users in same organization**
* Personal tasks visible only to the task owner
* Editable fields based on roles:

  * Work tasks → Only status + description editable
  * Personal tasks → Full edit allowed only for owner

###  Frontend UI (Angular)

* Clean task board UI with Tailwind
* Create, Update, Delete tasks
* Search tasks
* Drag and Drop (Angular CDK)
* Logout + auth guard protected routes

###  Testing

* Jest tests for:

  * Task Service (NestJS)
  * Angular components (Login, Register, Tasks)

#  Architecture Overview

```
secure-task-system/
│
├── apps/
│   ├── api/ → NestJS backend (Auth + Tasks)
│   └── dashboard/ → Angular frontend (Login + Tasks)
│
├── libs/
│   ├── data/ → TypeORM entities (User, Task, Organization)
│   └── auth/ → JWT Strategy, Guards, decorators
│
├── tools/ → Nx workspace tools
└── package.json
```

### Why This Architecture?

* **Nx Monorepo** → Shared code between backend & frontend
* **Data library** → Entities + enums re-used by API
* **Auth library** → Central auth logic for any future microservice
* **API decoupled from UI** → Allows mobile or other clients later

#  How to Run the Project

## 1️ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2️ Start PostgreSQL (Docker recommended)

```bash
docker run --name securetask-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
-p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

## 3️ Start the Backend (NestJS API)

```bash
npx nx serve api
```

Runs at:
 [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

---

## 4️ Start the Frontend (Angular Dashboard)

```bash
npx nx serve dashboard
```

Runs at:
 [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

#  User Roles & Access Control (RBAC)

| Role   | Create Personal | Create Work | Update Personal | Update Work               | Delete Work | Visibility        |
| ------ | --------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Viewer | ❌               | ❌           | ❌               | ❌                        | ❌        | Only own personal |
| Admin  | ✔               | ✔           | ✔               | Status + Description only | ✔           | Org tasks only    |
| Owner  | ✔               | ✔           | ✔               | ✔                         | ✔           | Org tasks only    |

#  Future Improvements (If More Time)

*  Organization dashboards & analytics
*  Invite users via email to organization
*  Task comments and file attachments
*  Real-time updates via WebSockets
*  Multi-tenancy with parent-child organizations
*  End-to-end Cypress tests
*  Mobile app using Ionic or React Native
